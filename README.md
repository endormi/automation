# Automation [![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6.1-brightgreen.svg?)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Collection of automated tasks.

> **Disclaimer**: Some of the scripts are small and may not be very useful for example [Send-email](https://github.com/endormi/automation/blob/master/send-email/email.py), but are still pretty cool :).

> I created some of the scripts with the intention that they're a foundation for more complex automated scripts such as. expenses, income, selenium-testing and a few more. The files that are these types of scripts will have (X).

Clone repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/endormi/automation.git && cd automation
```

Install requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run every script.
